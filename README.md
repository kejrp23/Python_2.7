# Python

This is where I will be putting my 
python thoughts and idea's.

I will also be putting my projects from various
websites here as storage and reference as I learn them.

I'll be editing them to try and make them into bigger better programs. If you see ways to clean up my code feel free to share. 



Thanks

Jason
